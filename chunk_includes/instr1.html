  <div> <p> In this study, you will be reading emails written by a few different people.  First, you'll learn a little bit about a person. We'll show you their name and picture and play a short sound introduction. </p>
  
  <p> Then, you'll see a series of emails written by that person.  For each email, we'll first show you the subject line.  You'll get a few seconds to read this.  Then, you'll see the email.  This will be displayed to you one word at a time and you will press the spacebar to see the next word. You'll read the whole email in this way, and then you'll be asked a question about the content of the email message. Read each message and answer each question as quickly and accurately as you can. </p> 
  
  <p> We will first walk through an example to show you what we mean. </p> 
  
  <p> The first thing you'll see in this example is an individual's name and picture, and you'll hear a sound introduction.</p>
