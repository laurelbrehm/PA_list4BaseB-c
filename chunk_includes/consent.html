<b> 1. Why is this research study being done?</b>
<p> We are asking you to be in this research because you speak one or more of the languages we are investigating as a first or second language.
</p><p>This research is being done to find out how people produce and comprehend sentences in their first and second languages.
</p><p>Approximately 2150 people will take part in this research study worldwide.
</p>
<b> 
2. What will happen in this research study?</b><p> In this study you will complete a task that is designed to test how you comprehend and produce sentences in either your first or second language. In addition to this primary task, you may be asked to complete one or more additional tasks that are designed to measure different aspects of native and foreign language proficiency, memory skills, vocabulary knowledge and overall reading speed. You will also be asked to complete a language background questionnaire so that we can learn more about your language learning experiences. The purpose of these additional tasks is to examine how one or more of these factors may influence language comprehension and language production, as measured in the primary comprehension or production task. Prior to each individual task you will also receive detailed instructions on how to complete that specific task.</p><p>When filling out any surveys or questionnaires, you are free to skip any questions you would prefer not to answer.
</p><p> 
<b> 3. What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?</b></p><p> While there are risks associated with this experiment, the long-term consequences of these risks are minimal and the anticipated risk level is low.
